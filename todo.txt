-use model.forward() to use teacher forcing to see in what proportion of steps is the predicted token the correct next token
        DONE

-make equal # of cells masked per spectrogram frame (timestamp)
    DONE
    -check whether there is currently an imbalance across different frequency bins

-try different formulas for saliency (beyond just magnitude of gradient)


- it could just be out of domain
-maybe using more bins would help? I know you can do this in hf but idk how rn
    -maybe this for part II of the project


-try models larger than "tiny"

!vocode the new spectrograms


-graded/translucent mask to better represent the disribution of different saliency scores
